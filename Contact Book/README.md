Contacts Book - C++ Final Project

Project Description:

The Contacts Book is a console-based object-oriented C++ application designed to manage a user's contact list with advanced features. It serves as a final project for an Object-Oriented Programming lab, focusing on the use of core OOP concepts such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, Operator Overloading, and Templates. The project aims to simulate real-world applications by extending a basic contacts management system with features like advanced searching, group management, history tracking, and more.

This project is targeted at students or developers looking to solidify their understanding of OOP principles and file handling in C++. While it is developed for use in a console, it can also be expanded into a GUI-based application using Windows Forms for enhanced user interaction. There is potential to further extend the application into a web or Android-based app, providing cloud storage support with Firebase for seamless data synchronization across devices.

Key Features:

Manage Contacts: Add, update, delete, and view detailed contact information.
Advanced Search: Perform a global search across all contact attributes (name, phone number, address) with smart partial matches.
Group Management: Create, view, and manage contact groups.
Search History: Track and display the search history with timestamps and view the top 5 most frequently viewed contacts.
File Handling: Save and load contact data, search history, and group information for persistent storage.
Resilient Data Storage: Automatic saving of data to prevent loss in case of program crashes.
Sorting and Reusability: Template-based sorting and reusable data structures like lists are implemented for various features.
Optional GUI: Support for a Windows Forms-based graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
Cloud Storage: Optional integration with Google Firebase for cloud-based storage of contacts and groups.

Who This Project Is For:

Students: Ideal for computer science students looking to apply their knowledge of OOP concepts and file handling in a practical project.
Developers: Can be extended into more advanced applications like web apps or mobile apps, providing a foundation for further development.
Educators: Suitable for educators teaching advanced C++ topics, offering a project that combines multiple key programming concepts into one application.


Creators:
This application was developed by me and my friend as our Object Oriented Programming project in 2nd semester.
